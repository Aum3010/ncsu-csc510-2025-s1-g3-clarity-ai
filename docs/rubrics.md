### Repository Rubric (projec2 only)


- The project repo **MUST** have a branch called `MAIN`. Groups will be assessed via their commit history (seen under "Insights") in `MAIN`.
  - Projects where all group members are not active in discussions will either lose marks, or the offending student may be expelled from the group.
- Projects where all group members are not actively making commits will lose marks, or the offending student may be expelled from the group.
  - To assess your involvement, we need to see your involvement 
  - So groups need to maintain an active discussion in some online forum.
    - e.g. GitHub issue reports will be fun.
    - e.g. Your private discord challen. 
    - Whatever forum you use, your poster (defined above) must include a QR code link that that location

Each team starts with full marks but **loses** 0.33 marks for missing items:

    - To a live demo (how you host the demo is up to you).
  - Include **3–5 implementation milestones** to improve Version i+1.
      - Milestones must demonstrate a **possible implementation plan** with clear goals.  
  - Have a clear mission statement paragraph. The why (the chalelnge you arerepsonding too) and the what (you will build) and the *so what (benefits of this sstem)
e.g. "Online content can be emotionally overwhelming our app helps make sense of it. Sentiment Analyzer Pro lets users analyze the emotional tone of text, images, news, speech, and even YouTube comments. Whether you're tracking brand sentiment, filtering negativity, or just staying informed, the app makes emotional insights fast and accessible. With a Chrome extension and improved Ul, it's now easier than ever to understand how content feels not just what it says."
  - List the stakeholders (e.g Admin, Staff, Customer. Who else?). Maybe as part of the mission statement?
  - Include at least 8 milestones cases (4 for October, a further 4 planned for "release2" in Novermber).
  - Show a group number
  - Show group member names
  - Show icons describing your proposed tech stack
  - Include small screen snap(s) of the  system (if you are some cli thing, then this will be simple: just a snap of some proposed call to some tool, with with some text printed out-
- Be ambitious. Dull milestones will lose you marks in Proj2
- Not be too ambitious (hey, be ware, you have to code this).
- For project 2: **Sell the software**:
    - Highlight what is bettre now that this code was written 
    - **Propose a better version (Version i+1):**
- **Boast your test cases**:
    - E.g., "One group listed 130+ test cases, showcasing their ability to make changes while maintaining old functionality."
